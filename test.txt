you need to init the git or
clone from the git

That was missing
it will create a hidden folder .git
which keeps track of your project

Let's say.. I edited this text file



See the commands now


Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   test.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
